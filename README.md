# Notes:
- First of all, you must obtain your own API keys. In this appplication, we will use two. One of them is at https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/, and the other key at https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.
- Once you have them, copy and paste the keys in the ".env" file right after "=" operator.
- Don't forget ```npm install``` and ```npm run start```.
- Great! The application is ready to use!
